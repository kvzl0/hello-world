sixty-ninth commit (06.20.25) Time Check 5:43 PM ---Too many happening inside my head, I'm currently in front of my laptop crying over things and decisions I've made these past few years. Too much realization. Too many things. It's just too much. I don't know what to do with my life right now. I also applied for the DOST JLSS scholarship. After I filled out the form, personal infomations, and other requirements, There's a note that the qualified students for this will receive an email for a test permit SOMETIME in June 2025. It's already June 20 ‚Äî 10 days left until July. If I don't receive a permit it would mean that I'm not qualified to take exam for the scholarship. I really need this scholarship especially that we're having a financial crisis and I'm on the verge of stopping school. if my parents wouldn't be able to give me financial support for my transportation. I can't stop overthinking if will I ever to receive a test permit for the exam? will I be able to pass that exam and get a scholarship? will I be able to maintain the grades if ever I get the scholarship? will I be able to get a job before I graduate? will I be able to be successful in life? will I be able to buy things that I wouldn't need to care much about the price tag? will I be able to live until 80?70?60?50?
