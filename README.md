sixty-ninth commit (06.20.25) Time Check 5:43 PM ---Too many happening inside my head, I'm currently in front of my laptop crying over things and decisions I've made these past few years. Too much realization. Too many things. It's just too much. I don't know what to do with my life right now. I also applied for the DOST JLSS scholarship. After I filled out the form, personal infomations, and other requirements, There's a note that the qualified students for this will receive an email for a test permit SOMETIME in June 2025. It's already June 20 ‚Äî 10 days left until July. If I don't receive a permit it would mean that I'm not qualified to take exam for the scholarship. I really need this scholarship especially that we're having a financial crisis and I'm on the verge of stopping school. if my parents wouldn't be able to give me financial support for my transportation. I can't stop overthinking if will I ever to receive a test permit for the exam? will I be able to pass that exam and get a scholarship? will I be able to maintain the grades if ever I get the scholarship? will I be able to get a job before I graduate? will I be able to be successful in life? will I be able to buy things that I wouldn't need to care much about the price tag? will I be able to live until 80?70?60?50?

I don't care about gifts, celebration or event getting a greeting for this day. All I need is for this chickenpox to heal. Am I asking too much? Did I do anything wrong to deserve what's happening in my life? All I want for this day is answers, answers for the reasons WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE SUFFERING FROM THIS FUCKING LIFE WHEN ALL THEY DO IS JUST ENJOY THEIR LIFE WHILE I ALWAYS SUFFER IN SILENCE? I HATE MY LIFE, I HATE EACH AND EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING TO ME. THESE AREN'T JUST CHALLENGES, THESE ARE CURSED! CURSED THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SUFFERING SINCE I WAS A CHILD. EVERY SINCE I WAS A CHILD I WAS FORCED TO BE THE SMALL PERSON, THE ONE WHO ADJUST, THE ONE WHO GIVE, AND THE ONE WHO LETS OTHER DO THEIR THING FIRST WHILE I WAS FORCED TO BE SILENT. NOT BY WORDS OF OTHERS BUT FORCED TO BE SILENT BECAUSE OF THESE EXPERIENCES. WHY I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE ONE SUFFERING FROM THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T DO IN THE FIRST PLACED?WHHY IT'S ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ME? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
